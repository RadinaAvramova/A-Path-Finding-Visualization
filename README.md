# Path Finding Visualization
Welcome to the Path Finding Visualization project! This application is a visualization tool built with Python that allows users to interactively visualize pathfinding algorithms. With the Path Finding Visualization tool, users can see how different algorithms navigate through grids to find the shortest path from a start point to an end point.

## Features
1. **Grid Creation:** Generates a grid of specified dimensions where users can define obstacles, start points, and end points.

2. **Algorithm Selection:** Provides a selection of pathfinding algorithms to visualize, including Dijkstra's algorithm, A* algorithm, breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), and more.

3. **Interactive Visualization:** Allows users to interactively visualize the pathfinding process, including how the algorithm explores the grid, evaluates potential paths, and ultimately finds the shortest path from start to end.

4. **Animation Control:** Offers controls to adjust the animation speed, allowing users to slow down or speed up the visualization process to better understand the algorithm's behavior.

5. **Path Highlighting:** Highlights the shortest path found by the algorithm once it reaches the end point, making it easy for users to see the optimal route.

## Installation
To run the Path Finding Visualization locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/RadinaAvramova/A-Path-Finding-Visualization.git

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Change your current directory to the location of the cloned repository:

cd A-Path-Finding-Visualization

3. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Run the Application:** Run the Python script to start the visualization tool:

python path_finding.py

5. **Access the Visualization Tool:** Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to the URL provided (usually http://localhost:5000) to access the Path Finding Visualization tool.

## Usage
1. **Create Grid:** Use the mouse to create a grid of specified dimensions. Click on individual cells to define obstacles, start points, and end points.

2. **Select Algorithm:** Choose a pathfinding algorithm from the available options to visualize. Algorithms include Dijkstra's algorithm, A* algorithm, BFS, DFS, and more.

3. **Visualize:** Click the "Visualize" button to start the visualization process. Watch as the algorithm explores the grid, evaluates potential paths, and finds the shortest path from start to end.

4. **Adjust Animation Speed:** Use the controls to adjust the animation speed to your preference. Slow down or speed up the visualization process to better understand the algorithm's behavior.

5. **View Shortest Path:** Once the algorithm reaches the end point, the shortest path found will be highlighted on the grid. Take note of the optimal route.

6. **Reset:** Optionally, reset the grid and start over by clicking the "Reset" button.

## Customization
You can customize the Path Finding Visualization tool by modifying aspects such as grid dimensions, obstacle density, algorithm selection, and animation speed. Additionally, you can add new algorithms, enhance the user interface, or integrate with additional data structures to expand the functionality of the tool.
